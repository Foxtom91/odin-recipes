        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>2 eggplants, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces thinly sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¾ cup finely grated Fontina cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat 2 baking sheets and a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Stir together 2 eggs and water in a shallow dish. Combine panko and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese in a second shallow dish. Dip eggplant slices in egg mixture and dredge in panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere and shaking off excess. Place on prepared baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, turning once and rotating baking sheets after 15 minutes, about 30 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta cheese, basil, 1 egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic, red pepper, and salt in a bowl to make filling.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/2 cup marinara sauce into the prepared baking dish. Layer 1/2 the eggplant slices over sauce and sprinkle with 1/8 teaspoon salt. Top with 3/4 cup marinara sauce. Spread 1/2 the ricotta mixture on top; add 1/2 the yellow and green bell peppers and top with 1/3 the mozzarella cheese and 1/4 the Fontina cheese. Repeat layers, ending with 1 cup marinara sauce. Cover tightly with aluminum foil coated with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove aluminum foil; top with remaining mozzarella cheese and Fontina cheese. Continue baking until sauce is bubbly and cheese melts, about 10 minutes more. Cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
